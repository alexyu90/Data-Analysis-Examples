## Citibike_insights_Oct_2019

This analysis explores a dataset of the ride histories of New York City's Citibike bikeshare system in October 2019. The dataset is downloaded from Citibike's official website: https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data

For this analysis, I am particularly interested in finding out where in the city did most of the bike rental happen in October 2019. Once the areas with the most bike rental activities are located, I am interested in understanding the composition of the users of rentals in these area, with an intention of providing insights to marketing agencies.

- Who's the more bankable? (highest average revenue)

## WeRateDogs_wrangling

- Which breed is the most featured?
- Which breed is the highest rated?
- Which endearing term is most frequently used?
